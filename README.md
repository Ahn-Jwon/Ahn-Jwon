      <p>
        I'm an iOS developer with a strong passion for building mobile experiences that are fast, intuitive, and scalable.  
        I specialize in Swift and SwiftUI, and I enjoy crafting smooth user interactions powered by Firebase and realtime data handling.  
        Beyond iOS, I explore cross-platform development with Flutter (Dart), and build web applications using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        My backend experience includes Node.js, Express, and Vapor (Swift), and I love building end-to-end features — from API to UI.
