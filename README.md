      <p>
        <strong>I'm an iOS developer</strong> with a strong passion for building mobile experiences that are fast, intuitive, and scalable.<br><br>
        I specialize in <strong>Swift</strong> and <strong>SwiftUI</strong>, and I enjoy crafting smooth user interactions powered by <strong>Firebase</strong> and realtime data handling.<br><br>
        Beyond iOS, I explore cross-platform development with <strong>Flutter (Dart)</strong>, and build web applications using <strong>React, Next.js, and TypeScript</strong>.<br><br>
        My backend experience includes <strong>Node.js, Express, and Vapor (Swift)</strong>, and I love building end-to-end features — from API to UI.
